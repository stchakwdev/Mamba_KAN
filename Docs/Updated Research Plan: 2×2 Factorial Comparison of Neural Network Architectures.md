# Updated Research Plan: 2×2 Factorial Comparison of Neural Network Architectures

**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** September 4, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

This updated research plan proposes a systematic 2×2 factorial experimental design to empirically evaluate the effects of two key architectural components in neural networks:

1. **Feedforward Component**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) vs. Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)
2. **Sequence Modeling Component**: Transformer vs. Mamba (State Space Model)

By testing all four permutations, we can isolate the individual and interaction effects of these components, providing much cleaner and more empirical insights than traditional pairwise comparisons.

## 2. Experimental Design: 2×2 Factorial Structure

### 2.1. The Four Model Variants

| Sequence Modeling | Feedforward Component | Model Name | Key Characteristics |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Transformer** | **MLP** | **MLP-Transformer** | Standard transformer (baseline) |
| **Transformer** | **KAN** | **KAN-Transformer** | Transformer with KAN feedforward blocks |
| **Mamba** | **MLP** | **MLP-Mamba** | Standard Mamba with MLP projections |
| **Mamba** | **KAN** | **KAN-Mamba** | Mamba with KAN-based projections |

### 2.2. Controlled Variables

To ensure fair comparison, all models will be controlled for:
- **Parameter count** (±5% tolerance)
- **Training data** (identical datasets and splits)
- **Training procedure** (same optimizer, learning rate schedule, etc.)
- **Computational budget** (same number of training steps/epochs)
- **Hardware environment** (same GPU setup)

### 2.3. Factorial Analysis Benefits

This design allows us to answer specific research questions:

1. **Main Effect of Feedforward Architecture**: Does KAN consistently outperform MLP across both sequence modeling approaches?
2. **Main Effect of Sequence Modeling**: Does Mamba consistently outperform Transformer across both feedforward approaches?
3. **Interaction Effects**: Are there synergistic or antagonistic effects between KAN and Mamba?
4. **Task-Specific Effects**: Do these effects vary across different types of tasks?

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1. Modular Architecture Design

Each model will be implemented with a modular design:

```python
class UnifiedModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, 
                 sequence_model_type: str,  # "transformer" or "mamba"
                 feedforward_type: str,     # "mlp" or "kan"
                 **kwargs):
        
        self.sequence_model = self._build_sequence_model(sequence_model_type)
        self.feedforward = self._build_feedforward(feedforward_type)
```

### 3.2. Parameter Matching Strategy

To ensure fair comparison, we will:
1. **Start with baseline MLP-Transformer** (e.g., GPT-2 124M parameters)
2. **Match parameters** for other variants by adjusting:
   - Hidden dimensions
   - Number of layers
   - KAN grid size (for KAN variants)
   - Mamba state size (for Mamba variants)

### 3.3. Implementation Resources

#### Base Implementations
- **MLP-Transformer**: NanoGPT as starting point
- **MLP-Mamba**: Official Mamba implementation
- **KAN Components**: PyKAN for KAN layers
- **Integration Framework**: PyTorch Lightning for unified training

#### Novel Implementations Needed
- **KAN-Transformer**: Replace MLP blocks in transformer with KAN layers
- **KAN-Mamba**: Replace MLP projections in Mamba with KAN functions

## 4. Evaluation Framework

### 4.1. Multi-Task Evaluation Suite

To test generalizability, we will evaluate on diverse tasks:

#### Mathematical Reasoning (Expected KAN Advantage)
- **GSM8K**: Grade school math problems
- **MATH**: Competition mathematics
- **Symbolic Regression**: Function discovery tasks

#### Long Sequence Modeling (Expected Mamba Advantage)
- **Long Range Arena**: Standardized long sequence benchmark
- **BookCorpus**: Long-form text modeling
- **Genomics**: DNA sequence analysis

#### General Language Understanding (Neutral Ground)
- **SuperGLUE**: Language understanding benchmark
- **HellaSwag**: Commonsense reasoning
- **PIQA**: Physical interaction reasoning

#### Code Understanding (Mixed Expectations)
- **HumanEval**: Code generation
- **MBPP**: Python programming problems
- **CodeSearchNet**: Code search and understanding

### 4.2. Statistical Analysis Plan

#### Primary Analysis: ANOVA
```
Performance ~ Feedforward_Type * Sequence_Type * Task_Type + Error
```

This will allow us to test:
- **Main effect of Feedforward**: KAN vs MLP
- **Main effect of Sequence**: Mamba vs Transformer  
- **Two-way interactions**: KAN×Mamba, KAN×Task, Mamba×Task
- **Three-way interaction**: KAN×Mamba×Task

#### Secondary Analyses
- **Effect sizes**: Cohen's d for practical significance
- **Efficiency analysis**: Performance per parameter, per FLOP
- **Scaling analysis**: How effects change with model size

### 4.3. Controlled Experimental Conditions

#### Training Protocol
- **Same random seeds** across all models
- **Same data preprocessing** and tokenization
- **Same training schedule** (learning rate, warmup, decay)
- **Same regularization** (dropout, weight decay)
- **Same evaluation protocol** (same test sets, metrics)

#### Hardware Standardization
- **Same GPU type** for all experiments
- **Same batch sizes** (adjusted for memory if needed)
- **Same precision** (fp16 or fp32 consistently)

## 5. Expected Outcomes and Hypotheses

### 5.1. Primary Hypotheses

1. **H1 (KAN Main Effect)**: KAN will outperform MLP on mathematical/symbolic tasks but not on general language tasks
2. **H2 (Mamba Main Effect)**: Mamba will outperform Transformer on long sequence tasks but may underperform on short sequence tasks
3. **H3 (Interaction Effect)**: KAN-Mamba will show synergistic effects on tasks requiring both long-range dependencies and mathematical reasoning

### 5.2. Efficiency Hypotheses

1. **Training Efficiency**: Mamba variants will train faster due to linear scaling
2. **Inference Efficiency**: Mamba variants will have better throughput on long sequences
3. **Memory Efficiency**: KAN variants may use more memory due to spline functions

### 5.3. Interpretability Hypotheses

1. **KAN Interpretability**: KAN variants will provide more interpretable learned functions
2. **Attention vs Selection**: Transformer attention will be more interpretable than Mamba's selective mechanism
